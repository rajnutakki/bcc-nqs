    Return `PGSymmetry` representing a translation followed by a 2D reflection across an axis at angle `angle` to the +x direction through the (0,0) point.
    This is equivalent to reflecting in the axis at angle `angle` passing through (0,0) and then translating by W@`t`, where W is
    the reflection matrix.
